When examining the performance of each video within the dataset, a correlation of 0.33 between view count and likes count indicates a moderate positive relationship. This implies that an increase in views tends to lead to a higher number of likes. However, it's noteworthy that the impact of views on likes count is not substantial, as evidenced by the relatively low correlation value. This is further supported by certain outliers in the scatter plots. For instance, specific videos with over 25 million views have garnered less than ten thousand likes. Conversely, there is a video in the dataset with over 250 thousand likes despite having only around 5 million views.
The correlation between comments count and view count is even weaker at 0.22, suggesting that viewers are less inclined to leave comments even when they engage with the content. Notably, a stronger relationship is observed between likes count and comments count, with a correlation value of 0.55. This indicates that likes tend to be more closely associated with the amount of comments. Individuals appear more likely to share their thoughts and ideas when expressing approval through likes.
Analyzing the relationship between likes count, views, and comments amount across different categories reveals an increase in correlation values. This suggests that these three metrics do impact each other to a certain extent. While more views generally lead to more likes and comments, the impact of views on comments is somewhat less pronounced, as indicated by the correlation values of 0.67 between views and likes, and 0.47 between views and comments.
Likes count demonstrates a particularly strong linkage with the volume of comments, as evidenced by a high correlation coefficient of 0.82. This reinforces the notion that an engaged audience, indicated by likes, is more likely to participate in discussions by leaving comments. Notably, certain categories, such as "News & Politics," stand out for their heightened level of audience interaction. Despite having a total view count of 16 million and less than 0.4 million likes, this category boasts over 50 thousand comments. This highlights a notable level of engagement and discussion surrounding news and political content.
While the "Entertainment" category does not have the highest view count within our sample set, it does stand out for having the highest likes and comments count. This suggests that while view count is a factor, engagement through likes and comments can be even more indicative of an active and enthusiastic audience.
	This data set shows that News and Politics & Entertainment were the most popular categories to create content for, while the category with the highest average likes per video are film and animation and comedy. It would be interesting to see if this trend holds over different data sets
	By Analysing the co relationship of the different categories against the view and comments we can conclude that for new content creators wish to monetarize their YouTube channel they should focus on the views they get for the videos rather than comments
	Views, likes, and comments are interrelated while their correlations vary. The strength of these relationships differs across categories, and likes and comments often play a pivotal role in gauging audience engagement and interaction.
